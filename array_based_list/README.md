# array_based_list

There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. In this project, our focus is on array based implementation. Written is a class named AList, AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member functions of List. A main function to demonstrates the functionality of AList class.

The AList class performs the following standard functions as a list:

- void clear()
- void insert(const T& item)
- void append(const T& item)
- T remove()
- void moveToStart()
- void moveToEnd()
- void prev()
- void next()
- int length()
- int currPos()
- void moveToPos(int pos)
- const T& getValue() const
